    <h1>Grey's Anatomy and How I was Introduced to it</h1>
    
        <p> Grey's Anatomy is a show on Netflix. It was introduced to me by my friends. Once I started watching the tv show, Meredith Grey became an inspiration to me. Many might say she's an inspiration to me because she's the main character, but to me, that's not the case. Meredith had a horrible childhood. Her mother neglected her all her life and never really wanted her. Later on about when Meredith was about 5, her parents had gotten a divorce. And her mother ran off with her to across the country away from her dad. She didn't have a father figure growing up but, he also never tried to get her back so that she could have him around. Besides all the stuff that happened to her growing up, she still had hope that she could become something in life apart from her past. She never gave up and went to Med school and now is a successful surgeon in the show. </p>
